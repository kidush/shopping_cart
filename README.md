## Shopping Cart application

It's a very basic shopping cart application built in Ruby.

### How to run
The application has been built using the latest version of ruby `3.1.1`, despite I didn't
used anything specific for this version I would recommend to download it and install it.

To install this ruby version you can use some tool like `rvm`, `rbenv` or `asdf` which is the tool I'm currently using.

For further details in how to install it, you can see [here](https://asdf-vm.com/).


So, before run the code and the tests, you should install the dependencies with `bundle`.

```
$ bundle install 
```

it will install the `rspec` dependency.

for running the tests, just run: 

```
$ bundle exec rspec specs/
```
